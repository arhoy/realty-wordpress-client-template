## Some instructions on how you can get started!

    -I recommend (pro edition with advanced custom fields) or create your own if you want to
  - ACF to Rest API (free!)
  - Advanced Custom Fields (free edition enough but pro if you need the extra functionality)

## Data

- If you want to upload your data one by one that is fine
- If you need lots of data WPAllImport will save you time
